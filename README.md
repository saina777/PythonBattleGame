## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1: Set Up the Game**  
   - Initialize the game environment.  
   - Configure the game board and rules.  
   - Prepare the backend logic for player interactions.

2. **Task 2: Prompt Player Choice**  
   - Implement prompts for player decisions (e.g., attack coordinates).  
   - Validate player inputs to ensure they adhere to game rules.  
   - *Completed at 10:33*  

3. **Task 3: Handle Player Choice and Character Selection**  
   - Process player choices and update the game state accordingly.  
   - Manage character selection (e.g., assigning ships or roles).

4. **Task 4: Battle with the Dragon!**  
   - Execute the battle logic between the player and the opponent (referred to as "the Dragon").  
   - Determine win/lose conditions and end-game scenarios.  
   - *Completed at 10:34*  

## How to Run
